How to run Selenium on Docker:

1. Execute this command in terminal:  docker pull selenium/standalone-chrome
2. Once this is done, Execute the following in a seperate terminal: “docker run --rm -it -p 4444:4444 -p 7900:7900 --shm-size 2g selenium/standalone-chrome”
3. The last line will give you the ip to run: 22:24:58.700 INFO [Standalone.execute] - Started Selenium Standalone 4.17.0 (revision e52b1be057*):http://172.17.0.2:4444 (Not sure if this IP is different for everyone)
4. Once you run this you can then run docker compose up and run ONE of the scraping functions (only working with linkedin right now)
5. To run it, cd to the python container, then do: docker build -t test .
6. once this is done, make sure the standalone chrome container is running, then do: docker run test
7. If you want to run a different scraping function or re run the same one, you close the standalone chrome that is executing in your seperate terminal and re run the command on line 2
